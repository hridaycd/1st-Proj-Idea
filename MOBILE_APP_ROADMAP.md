# Mobile App Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status: Web Application
Your booking management system is currently a **web application** that runs in browsers. To make it Google Play Store ready, you need to create a **native mobile app**.

## 📱 Mobile App Development Options

### Option 1: React Native (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Reuse existing React knowledge
- Single codebase for iOS and Android
- Large community and ecosystem
- Fast development

**Cons:**
- Some native features may require custom development
- Performance slightly less than native

**Timeline:** 2-3 months

### Option 2: Flutter
**Pros:**
- Excellent performance
- Beautiful UI components
- Single codebase for multiple platforms
- Growing popularity

**Cons:**
- Need to learn Dart language
- Different from your current React stack

**Timeline:** 3-4 months

### Option 3: Native Development
**Pros:**
- Best performance
- Full platform integration
- Access to all native features

**Cons:**
- Need separate apps for iOS and Android
- Longer development time
- Higher cost

**Timeline:** 6-8 months

  );
};
```

### 3. Camera Integration
```javascript
// Install: npm install react-native-image-picker
import {launchImageLibrary} from 'react-native-image-picker';

const selectImage = () => {
  launchImageLibrary({mediaType: 'photo'}, (response) => {
    if (response.assets) {
      console.log(response.assets[0]);
    }
  });
};
```

### 4. Payment Integration

    },
    theme: {color: '#53a20e'}
  };
  
  RazorpayCheckout.open(options).then((data) => {
    console.log(`Success: ${data.razorpay_payment_id}`);
  }).catch((error) => {
    console.log(`Error: ${error.code} | ${error.description}`);
  });
